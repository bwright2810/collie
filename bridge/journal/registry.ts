// The journal registry — the SINGLE decision site for "which agents have a readable history".
//
// Maps a Herdr snapshot `agent` string to its JournalAdapter; anything absent from the map has no
// journal, which the history route reports as an ordinary `no-session` rather than an error. Adding a
// harness is a one-line change to the list below plus its adapter module — never a new branch in the
// route or the store.
//
// This deliberately mirrors `web/src/lib/harness/registry.ts`, but the two are NOT the same seam and
// must not be conflated: the frontend harness registry owns block grammars and the send guard for the
// LIVE MIRROR; this one owns reading an on-disk log. A harness can plausibly have one without the
// other.
