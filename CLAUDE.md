# CLAUDE.md — working agreement for this repo

**Collie** (repo `AltanS/collie`) — a phone web UI for your Herdr agent herd, served over
Tailscale. A mobile-first PWA (Vite + React + TS + Tailwind v4 + shadcn) plus a Bun/TS bridge that
talks to Herdr's Unix socket, letting you monitor and reply to agents from a phone. The Herdr
plugin id is `herdr.collie` (manifest: `herdr-plugin.toml`). Orientation:
[`README.md`](./README.md) · [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) · verified API
[`HERDR_API.md`](./HERDR_API.md) · decisions [`.adr/`](./.adr/) · adding a harness
[`HARNESS_CONTRIBUTING.md`](./HARNESS_CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Decision records — read before reopening a settled question

[`.adr/`](./.adr/) holds the decisions whose reasoning would otherwise live only in a PR thread —
specifically the ones that **close off an option someone will reasonably propose again**. If you're
about to argue *why not* rather than *how*, check there first; if the answer isn't there and the
decision is that shape, add one (numbering + format: [`.adr/README.md`](./.adr/README.md)).

Rules elsewhere in this file stay short and normative and link to the ADR for the argument. Don't
restate an ADR's reasoning here, and don't edit a superseded ADR into agreement with the present —
mark it superseded and write the next one.

## Versioning — MANDATORY

This plugin is **SemVer**ed, and the version is **enforced**, so it never silently drifts.

**The version lives in three files that must always agree, plus a matching CHANGELOG entry:**
`herdr-plugin.toml` (canonical — Herdr reads it) · `package.json` · `web/package.json` ·
newest `## [x.y.z]` heading in `CHANGELOG.md`.

**Before committing any functional change** (anything under `bridge/`, `web/src/`, `scripts/`, or the
manifest) you MUST:

1. **Bump** the version in all three files to the same number:
   - **PATCH** (`0.2.0 → 0.2.1`): bug fix / internal refactor, no behavior change.
   - **MINOR** (`0.2.0 → 0.3.0`): new backward-compatible capability.
   - **MAJOR** (`0.2.0 → 1.0.0`): breaking change to config, API, or behavior.
2. **Add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry** under a new `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD` heading (Added / Changed /
   Fixed). Use the real date. **Style: super crisp and short** — one line per change, no prose
   paragraphs, and cite the feature's short commit hash at the end of the line (`… (abc1234)`).
   Land features as their own commits first, then cut the release commit so the entry can cite them.
3. **Run `scripts/check-version.sh`** — it must print `✓`.

Doc-only changes (`*.md`) don't need a bump. This is enforced two ways, but **you are the first
line — do it as part of the change, not after**:

- `scripts/check-version.sh` runs inside `scripts/collie-ctl.sh build` (a release can't build while
  versions disagree).
- A **git pre-commit hook** (`scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit`, activate once with
  `scripts/install-hooks.sh`) blocks commits where functional code changed but the version didn't.
  Escape hatch for a single commit: `SKIP_VERSION_CHECK=1 git commit …`.

**Tag the release when you push it.** Cutting a release means the three version files + the newest
`CHANGELOG.md` heading agree on `x.y.z` (steps 1–3). When that release lands on `main` and you push,
**always push a matching annotated git tag with it** — `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Collie X.Y.Z" && git
push origin vX.Y.Z` (or `git push --follow-tags` so the tag ships *with* the release). One `v<x.y.z>`
tag per shipped version on the remote. Not hook-enforced — it's on you. (Adding/adjusting this note is
a doc-only change and needs no version bump.)

**Update notice (user-facing).** The app's in-app update banner links to the newest release's GitHub
page and shows the command to run. Pushing a `v*` tag auto-creates that GitHub Release (with the
commands) via `.github/workflows/release.yml`. **Always express user-facing update/restart
instructions as Herdr plugin actions** — `herdr plugin action invoke update --plugin herdr.collie`
(or `restart`) — never `collie-ctl.sh …` / `systemctl … collie`, which depend on the caller's cwd and
the unit name; the Herdr action runs from anywhere.

## Build / run (operational facts that are easy to forget)

- **Frontend changes** (`web/`): rebuild with `bun run build` (root) or `cd web && bun run build`.
  The bridge serves `web/dist` **from disk at request time**, so on the deployment host
  a rebuild is **immediately live — no restart**.
- **Backend changes** (`bridge/*.ts`): Bun does **not** hot-reload the service — you must
  `systemctl --user restart collie`. Forgetting this is the #1 "my change didn't take" trap.
- `bun run build` (root) and `collie-ctl.sh build` **typecheck both sides first** (root tsc + web
  tsc), then build web to `dist-staging` and swap it in atomically — a failed build never empties a
  live `web/dist`. Bare `cd web && bun run build` still skips typechecking; don't ship from it.
- **Tests:** frontend `cd web && bun run test` (Vitest + jsdom + Testing Library + MSW; no headless
  browser); backend `bun run test` at the root — Bun's own runner over every pure-logic module in
  `bridge/` (access checks, state engine, config, journal adapters, notifications, uploads, …) plus
  `scripts/collie-ctl.test.sh`, which exercises the ctl lifecycle in a sandboxed HOME.
  A **pre-push hook** (`scripts/git-hooks/pre-push`) runs **both** before
  every push — override once with `SKIP_TESTS=1 git push`. The bits that genuinely need `Bun.serve` /
  `Bun.connect` (HTTP handlers, the socket client) stay unit-untested — Vitest-on-Node can't run them,
  so keep new backend logic pure/injectable enough for `bun test`, or exercise it through `web/`.
- Service: `systemd --user` unit `collie` on the deployment host; logs `journalctl --user -u collie -f`.
- **Dependencies must be 7 days old to install** (`bunfig.toml` + `web/bunfig.toml`, mirrored in
  `.npmrc` for npm users) — a compromised release is usually pulled within hours. A brand-new
  version resolving to an older one is the rule working, not a bug; CI's `--frozen-lockfile` is
  unaffected.
- TS is strict on both sides, with `noUnusedLocals/Parameters` everywhere. **`web/` additionally**
  enforces `verbatimModuleSyntax` + `erasableSyntaxOnly` (use `import type`, no parameter-property
  shorthand there). The **bridge** tsconfig does not enable those two — bridge code uses
  parameter-property shorthand by convention; keep each side consistent with itself.

## Frontend data layer (React Router, not TanStack)

- Data flows through **React Router** (`createBrowserRouter`, data mode): route **loaders**
  (`web/src/lib/loaders.ts`) fetch the snapshot + pane; **polling is `useRevalidator()` on an
  adaptive interval** (`web/src/hooks/use-polling.ts`); mutations are direct `lib/api.ts` calls
  followed by `revalidator.revalidate()`. There is **no TanStack Query** — don't reintroduce it.
- Routes (`web/src/router.tsx`): `/`, `/space/:spaceId`, `/settings`, `/pane/:paneId` and
  `/pane/:paneId/history`. The idle-lock in `App.tsx` unmounts the
  `RouterProvider` to pause polling; the router instance is module-scoped so it keeps its location.
- **PWA** via `vite-plugin-pwa` (`web/vite.config.ts`): manifest + `sw.js`, registered manually
  from `virtual:pwa-register` in `main.tsx` (bundled = CSP-safe). Install/SW need a **secure
  context** — over plain HTTP they no-op silently (Chrome insecure-origin flag, or HTTPS, to test).

## Herdr socket gotchas (see HERDR_API.md for the full, verified contract)

- RPC is **one-shot**: one request per connection; the server closes after one reply. `id` must be
  a **string**. Only `events.subscribe` streams.
- `pane.send_keys` grammar is **`+`-joined, not tmux**: `ctrl+c` (NOT `C-c`), `shift+tab`, `Up`,
  `Tab`, `Escape`, `Enter`, `Backspace`. `PageUp`/`Home`/`End`/`Delete` are unsupported.
- Pane output is rendered as **React text nodes** (never `innerHTML`); the ANSI parser only derives
  colors/weights. Keep it that way — it's the XSS boundary. Strict CSP + same-origin gate stay.
- **Never use a `dark:` variant inside the mirror `<pre>`** — it tracks the root theme, which is
  backwards in a surface that renders dark under every theme and inverts in light
  ([ADR 0002](./.adr/0002-invert-the-light-terminal-mirror.md)). Fails silently;
  `ansi-output.test.tsx` guards it.

## The journal (scrollback the mirror can't give you)

`bridge/journal/` reads the agent's own session log off disk, per harness (`claude` / `codex` / `pi`,
registered in `registry.ts`). It is the **only** thing in the bridge that touches the filesystem, so
the containment rule in [`files.ts`](./bridge/journal/files.ts) is absolute: **every** path an
adapter is about to read goes through `containedRealpath` — after symlink resolution, on the real
paths, including paths derived from one already checked. The client never supplies a path. Run
`bun scripts/journal-probe.ts` against real logs after touching an adapter; unit tests pin the
grammar, the probe catches on-disk format drift.

## Security posture (don't regress)

Loopback bind only · exactly one hardened front door — `tailscale serve` (never `funnel`) or a
conforming reverse proxy per README Variant C (`COLLIE_SKIP_SERVE=1`) · same-origin gate · optional
identity/device gates · strict CSP. A socket call can type into a real terminal — treat the bridge as
remote shell access.

**Collie manages exactly one front door: `tailscale serve`** — `collie-ctl.sh` publishes it, records
the mapping in `tailscale-managed-handler`, and only ever tears down a mapping matching that record.
Every other tunnel (NetBird, ZeroTier, Cloudflare Tunnel) is `COLLIE_SKIP_SERVE=1` + README Variant
E: the operator owns the ingress, Collie publishes nothing. **Don't add a second managed front
door** — [ADR 0001](./.adr/0001-one-managed-front-door.md).
